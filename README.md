# [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) Monolog Handler

Rocket.Chat Monolog Handler created to be used on Laravel Projects, originally developed by Sysvale. Adapted from Slack's Monolog Handler implementation and forked from https://github.com/sysvale/rocketchat-monolog-handler.

Also inspired by:
 - https://github.com/beeproger/rocketchat-monolog-handler

 - https://github.com/martinusso/monolog-rocketchat-handler

"repositories": [
	{
		"type": "vcs",
		"url": "https://github.com/userh-dev/rocketchat-monolog-handler.git",
		"no-api": true
	}
]
```

composer require userh-dev/rocketchat-monolog-handler
```

## Usage

This is an early version. Documentation under development. For directions in Portuguese, see the [original repository](https://github.com/sysvale/rocketchat-monolog-handler). It works exactly the same, for now.
